# Probability II FCDS Project

## A - Descriptive Statistics

1. **Distribution of Data using Skewness and Kurtosis**  
   - Calculate and interpret the skewness and kurtosis of the data.
   
2. **Knowledge of Some Plots (Using and How to Draw)**  
   - **i. Dot Plot**: Visualizing individual data points.
   - **ii. Box Plot**: Displaying the distribution and summary of data through quartiles.
   - **iii. Stem and Leaf Plot**: A textual representation of data distribution.

3. **How to Define Skewness Type from Graph**  
   - Interpretation of skewness from graphical representations:
     - **Positively Skewed**: Longer tail on the right.
     - **Negatively Skewed**: Longer tail on the left.
     - **Symmetrical**: Data is evenly distributed around the center.

## B - Inferential Statistics

### ANOVA: Analysis of Variance
- **When to Use**: Used to compare means between three or more groups.
- **How to Use**: Assumptions include normality, independence, and homogeneity of variance.
- **Laws and Calculation**: The F-statistic is calculated by comparing the variance between groups to the variance within groups.
- **Solved Example with Steps**: Detailed steps for conducting and interpreting the ANOVA test.

## Team Information

- **Project Delivery Window**: Week of 21/12 to 27/12.
